# Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange & XOR Cipher
## Introduction
This project is aimed at creating a Java implementation of the **Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange Algorithm** along with encryption/decryption using the **XOR Cipher**.
## Specific Nature
Implementation is done in such a way that multiple users can participate in the key exchange rather than just two. The non-secret large prime number and it's primitive root modulo are pre-defined and can be changed to larger values for highier security. It extensively uses the ```java.math.BigInteger``` class to handle the large numbers. This helps it to be easily developed and used.
